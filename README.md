# Data Analysis Repo
Here is a place for a data analysis projects.
I am looking for insights and creating business value thanks to visualisation and Machine Learning tools.

## Bank Marketing data

  **Relevant Information:**

   The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. 
   The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, 
   in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be (or not) subscribed. 
   
  There are two datasets: 
    1) bank-full.csv with all examples, ordered by date (from May 2008 to November 2010).
    2) bank.csv - undersampled dataset. In this file there is similar count of positive and negative samples, what is very helpful in creating ML model.
     The smaller dataset is useful to test more computationally demanding machine learning algorithms (e.g. SVM).

  Number of Instances: 45211 for bank-full.csv
  
  Number of Attributes: 16 + output attribute.
